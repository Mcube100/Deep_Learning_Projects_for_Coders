# Deep_Learning_Projects_for_Coders
This repository contains code and notebooks for the course "Practical Deep Learning for Coders" by fast.ai. 
I'm following this course to learn how to apply deep learning and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.
The code in this repository implements various deep learning models for tasks like computer vision, natural language processing, and more.
Feel free to explore the notebooks, experiment with the code, and contribute your own learnings!
